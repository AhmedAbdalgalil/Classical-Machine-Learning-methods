solving Classical Machine Learning methods Assignment 

Solve all the problems using MATLAB or any other computer 
language.
2. After calculating the best model given your data, review the given 
data and you may remove any possible outliers (a value with a 
possible error or high noise), then recalculate the model for cleaned 
data. Compare the two models. This exists only in problems 1 and 5.
3. Try by hand the linear and the logistic problems as well. You may use 
an excel sheet for this calculation.
4. In all your answers to each question, write down the equations of your 
solutions (after calculating their parameters). 
5. Hint: it is better to take the model of a lower number of parameters if 
the gain in R 2 is not high enough.


The numbers of insured persons y with an insurance company for the years 1987 to 
1996 are shown in the table. 
Year 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996
y 14000 13000 12000 11000 1050 10000 9500 9000 8700 8000

Make a scatterplot of the data, letting x represent the number of years since 1987.
a) Fit linear, quadratic, cubic, by comparing the values of 
2 R . Determine the 
function that best fits the data. (Hint: take care of note 4 above)
b) In all your answers in each model, write down the equations of your solutions
(after calculating its parameters).
c) Graph the function of best fit with the scatterplot of the data.
d) With the best function found in part (b), predict the average number of insured 
persons in 1997.


2. The following data was obtained by throwing a rubber ball. 
Time (sec) Height (m)
0.0000 1.03754
0.1080 1.40205
0.2150 1.63806
0.3225 1.77412
0.4300 1.80392
0.5375 1.71522
0.6450 1.50942
0.7525 1.21410
0.8600 0.83173
a) Fit linear, quadratic, cubic, and power functions to the data. By comparing the 
values of
2 R
, determine the function that best fits the data.
b) In all your answers in each model, write down the equations of your solutions
(after calculating its parameters).
c) Graph the function of best fit with the scatterplot of the data.
d) Determine the maximum height of the ball (in meters).
e) With the model you selected in part (b), predict when the height of the ball is at 
least 1.5 meters.




3. Develop a model for estimating heating oil used for a single-family home in the 
month of January based on average temperature and amount of insulation in inches.
Oil Temp F Insulation
275 40 4
360 27 4
160 40 10
40 73 6
90 65 7
230 35 40
370 10 6
300 9 10
230 24 10
120 65 4
30 66 10
200 41 6
440 22 4
323 40 4
50 60 10



a) Fit linear, quadratic functions to the data. By comparing the values of
2 R , 
determine the function that best fits the data. 
b) In all your answers in each model, write down the equations of your solutions (after 
calculating its parameters).
c) Then use the regression models for the functions in b to predict the needed oil if the 
temperature is 10 Fahrenheit and the insulation is 5 attic insulations inches.
d) What is your recommendation for the company?
e) You may review the data and remove what is outside the reasonable range (outlier), 
then recalculate the results and compare
